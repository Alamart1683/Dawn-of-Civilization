		<English>[TAB]The CN Tower, at 553.33 metres (1,815 feet, 5 inches) tall, is one of the world's tallest freestanding structures on land. It is located in the city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and is considered the signature icon of the city. [PARAGRAPH:1]The CN Tower consists of several substructures. The main portion of the Tower consists of a hollow concrete pillar containing the elevators, stairwells and power and plumbing connections. On top is the 102 m (335 ft) metal broadcast antenna, carrying TV and radio signals. There are two main visitor areas, the main seven-story pod located at the 330 m (1,100 ft) level, and the SkyPod at 447 m (1,465 ft), just below the antenna. Microwave antennas ring the lower portion of the main pod, protected in a large white donut-shaped radome.</English>
