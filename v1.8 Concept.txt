Adaptive changes to China
	- first UHV goal requires Confucian cathedrals again
	- return the pavillion as Chinese UB
	- new leaders to replace Ming Taizu: Yongle/Zhu Di (database) and Tang Taizong (Firaxis download)
	
Change India's second UHV goal: build 24 temples

Add the following wonders:
	Borobudur (Machinery, Aesthetics), requires Buddhism: +1 artist slot per temple
	Khajuraho (Theology, Aesthetics), requires Hinduism: +100% religious building construction speed [no graphics yet]
	Harmandir Sahib (Military Tradition), requires Hinduism: +2 experience for units built in cities with state religion [no graphics yet]
	Himeji Castle (Feudalism, Masonry), requires Buddhism: +100% gold from pillaging, no pillage on own territory

	Great Bath (Pottery), requires Hinduism, expires with Construction: provides fresh water, +1 population for every founded city
	Unsure/no appropriate effects yet: Jokhang (Buddhism), Lakshminarayan (Hinduism)
	Change Terracotta Army and Great Wall to Confucian wonders
	Change Topkapi Palace to its "recruit vassal's UUs" effect
	Change St. Basil's Cathedral to a Late Middle Ages wonder that gives +2 espionage per state religion building
	Jokhang (Theology): Unlimited missionaries, enemy players never refuse to talk

Add the following wonders (but maybe only with 1.9):
	Empire State Building (Radio): +1 commerce per population in the city
	Golden Gate Bridge (Steel, Assembly Line): -4 food, +1 food per water tile
	Trafalgar Square (Military Tradition): +4 experience for all naval units
	
Change Mongolia's second UHV goal: control 7 foreign cores by 1400 AD

Mongol horde event:
	By making contact with [India, Persia, Arabia, Byzantium, Russia] AI Mongolia automatically declares war on them and spawns an army

Corporation rework: the new eight corporations will be:
	Silk Route (Currency): +gold, food from silk
	Trading Company (Astronomy): +gold, food from cotton, spices, sugar, ivory
	
	Steel Industry (Steel, GE); +production from iron, copper, coal
	Luxury Industry (Assembly Line, GA): +gold, culture from gold, silver, gems, silk
	Oil Industry (Combustion, GE): +gold from oil
	Computer Industry (Computers, GS): +science from copper, aluminum, oil
	Cereal Industry (Biology, GM): +food from from wheat, rice, corn
	Fishing Industry (Refrigeration, GM): +food from fish, crab, clam

	The rules for corporations change as well and are now similar to SoI's companies. That means:
		- there are no corporation executives anymore
		- corporations can spread to any city whose owner knows the prerequisite tech
		- probability of spreading based on a number of factors like number of owned consumed resources, present buildings or civics
		- the two preindustrial corporations follow special rules:
			- they disappear after discovering a certain tech (Astronomy for Silk Route, Assembly Line for Trading Company)
			- they can spread only to cities in certain areas (China, Mongolia, Persia, Mesopotamia, Levant, Anatolia, Balkans and Italy for Silk Route, Carribean Sea, African Coast, India and the East Indies for Trading Company)
			- they have no corporation headquarter
		- the corporations do not need to get founded before they can spread, the tech alone is enough
		- players can still found corporation headquarters by using GP to acquire the additional gold
		- you can even build already constructed headquarters again to secure it for your civ (using a GP again), however, he needs to control more associated resources than the current holder

	The two preindustrial corporations have been explicitly designed to improve the silk route cities or one tile islands in the aforementioned regions to better represent their historical value.

Religion rework: non-state religions now give -1 happiness from the start, i.e. its canceled out by building its temple

New Indian UP: The Power of Spirituality: no penalties from non-state religions, no anarchy from switching religions

New Babylonian UP: The Power of Law: no anarchy from switching civics

-> playtest Korea (overall performance, UHV), Mongols (UHV), India (UHV, Khajuraho gambit), Khmer (Borobudur gambit), Spain/Portugal (Trading Company corporation)

Help the AI along with better flips in some aspects (larger for some civs like Russia, Mongolia, America; flip all resulting indie cities if AI enemy collapses for Mongolia)
