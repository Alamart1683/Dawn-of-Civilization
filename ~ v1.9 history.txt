# New Reformation mechanic, Protestant shrine isn't built automatically anymore, three choices:
	- Embrace the Reformation: state religion becomes Protestantism, cities convert to Protestantism, Catholicism can remain in larger cities, 100 gold per Catholic city, if this civ has founded Protestantism, it gets the shrine for free, Catholic civs may declare war
	- Tolerate the new sects: State religion remains Catholic, Protestantism spreads to your cities and can even replace Catholicism
	- Join the Counter-Reformation: State religion remains Catholic, Protestantism only rarely spreads to your cities, you declare war on all civs that embraced the Reformation

# Adjusted several UHV goals to different game speeds
# Byzantium spawns with a navy now
# Respawning civs now correctly ask to flip human cities
