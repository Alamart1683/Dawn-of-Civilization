# anarchy doesn't cost golden age turns
# reduced blockade range to 2
# the number of bonus resources that can influence your corporation yield is capped at 12 per type
# new stability mechanics:
	# stability checks are now triggered by certain events (discovering a tech, changing civics, losing/acquiring a city, starting wars, making peace ...) instead of being periodical
	# stability values aren't saved anymore, they are calculated for your empire as is and discarded afterwards, "permanent stability hits" are therefore gone
	# instead of these values, only a stability level is stored: collapsing, unstable, shaky, stable or solid
	# stability is divided in five categories: expansion, economy, domestic, foreign and military
	# at every check your stability level can increase or decrease depending on your value, and a crisis may occur
	# the severity of a crisis depends on your stability level, while the effects depend on the stability category with the lowest value
	# a terminal crisis (possible only at unstable or collapsing) results in a complete collapse
