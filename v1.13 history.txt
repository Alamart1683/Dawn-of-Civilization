	# instead of culture expansion when a city reaches a new culture level, the covered tiles gradually expand as a city gets more culture
	# city culture can only extend up to the third ring
	# more culture required to cover the entire second ring
	# properties of the plot influence how much culture it takes to cover it (more for desert, peaks ..., less for tiles with bonuses or river connections, making for more geographically appropriate borders)
	# tiles get covered in order of their culture costs (cheapest first)
	# you can also take control of a tile by building a fort on it
